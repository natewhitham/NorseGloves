	<h3> Family History </h3>
	<p>
		The BBQ Pit now is a well-known BBQ food chain that is starting to spread out of the Midwest, but it was not always a BBQ hotspot. The BBQ Pit has been family run for four generations, starting with the current owner's great-grandfather Marvin. Marvin grew up in Decorah, IA with a passion for food. As a boy, he traveled to Kansas City and had BBQ food for the first time and was instantly hooked. As he got holder he started smoking his own food, eventually he started getting a bit of a following and with the help of his son Barney, the opened the first BBQ Pit in Decorah, IA. Barney then took over the business and eventually opened a second restaurant when his son Marshall could run his own. Marshall with the help of his two sons Glenn and Ted, could expand once again. Since Glenn has become the head pit master, the national recognition for The BBQ Pit has grown significantly after the won the Award for Best BBQ Sauce, with their Awesome Sauce. Ted has taken over the traditional business side of the operation and is closing in on a deal that would allow for the sale of their BBQ sauce and rubs at select locations. Ted and Glennâ€™s sons have already gotten a head start on the family business by creating their own rub and entering a BBQ contest in Kansas City, MO and winning by a land slide.
